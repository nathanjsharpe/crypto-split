Your Task:
You are to make a cli that takes in a USD amount as holdings, and calculates the 70/30 split for 2 given crypto currencies. Stated simply: I have $X I want to keep in BTC and ETH, 70/30 split. How many of each should I buy? An example usage would look like:

binary_name 100 BTC ETH

This output should be in the following format:

$70.00 => 0.0025 BTC
$30.00 => 0.0160 ETH

This output tells us: Of our 100$ holdings, 70% of that is 70$, which buys 0.0025 BTC, and 30% of our holdings is 30$, which buys 0.016 ETH
